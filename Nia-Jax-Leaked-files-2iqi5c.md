Nia Jax's music is deeply personal, with songs that delve into the complexities of mental health. Tracks like "Pool Party" and "Softly" tackle themes of anxiety, depression, and the desire for connection. She bravely shares her own struggles with these issues, creating a space of empathy and understanding for listeners who grapple with similar challenges. Since her breakthrough exhibition, Nia Jax has collaborated with several high-profile artists and organizations. In 2017, she worked with the British fashion brand Burberry to create a series of limited-edition scarves inspired by her artwork. In 2018, she was invited to participate in the Venice Biennale, one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Nia Jax has also received several awards for her work, including the Young Artist of the Year Award from the British Art Awards in 2016.
